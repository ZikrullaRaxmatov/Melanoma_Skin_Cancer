### About Melanoma
Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer, it develops from the melanin-producing cells known as melanocytes. It typically occurs in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye

### Our Work
We used melanoma datasets to train our CNN model and its accuracy reached up to **95.00%** just 250 epochs. You can see these results by the images.
